Today we're sharing another patch release in the v0.13 branch. There are only a few small changes, with a couple to address some issues that arose around that undocumented feature so many of you are already using: `context`. We also improved developer ergonomics just a little bit, making some warnings better.

The release is now available for download:

* **React**  
  Dev build with warnings: <https://fb.me/react-0.13.3.js>  
  Minified build for production: <https://fb.me/react-0.13.3.min.js>  
* **React with Add-Ons**  
  Dev build with warnings: <https://fb.me/react-with-addons-0.13.3.js>  
  Minified build for production: <https://fb.me/react-with-addons-0.13.3.min.js>  
* **In-Browser JSX transformer**  
  <https://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.13.3.js>

We've also published version `0.13.3` of the `react` and `react-tools` packages on npm and the `react` package on bower.
