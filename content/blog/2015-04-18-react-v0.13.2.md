Yesterday the [React Native team shipped v0.4](/blog/2015/04/17/react-native-v0.4.html). Those of us working on the web team just a few feet away couldn't just be shown up like that so we're shipping v0.13.2 today as well! This is a bug fix release to address a few things while we continue to work towards v0.14.

The release is now available for download:
