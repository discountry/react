In the weeks following the [open-source release](/blog/2015/08/11/relay-technical-preview.html) of the Relay technical preview, the community has been abuzz with activity. We are honored to have been able to enjoy a steady stream of ideas and contributions from such a talented group of individuals. Let's take a look at some of the things we've achieved, together!

## Teaching servers to speak GraphQL

Every great Relay app starts by finding a GraphQL server to talk to. The community has spent the past few weeks teaching GraphQL to a few backend systems.

Bryan Goldstein ([brysgo](https://github.com/brysgo)) has built a tool to help you define a GraphQL schema that wraps a set of [Bookshelf.JS](http://bookshelfjs.org/) models. Check out [graphql-bookshelf](https://github.com/brysgo/graphql-bookshelf).

RisingStack ([risingstack](https://github.com/risingstack)) created a GraphQL ORM called [graffiti](https://github.com/RisingStack/graffiti) that you can plug into [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and serve using Express, Hapi, or Koa.

David Mongeau-Petitpas ([dmongeau](https://github.com/dmongeau)) is working on a way to vend your Laravel models through a GraphQL endpoint, [laravel-graphql](https://github.com/Folkloreatelier/laravel-graphql).

Gerald Monaco ([devknoll](https://github.com/devknoll)) created [graphql-schema](https://github.com/devknoll/graphql-schema) to allow the creation of JavaScript GraphQL schemas using a fluent/chainable interface.

Jason Dusek ([solidsnack](https://github.com/solidsnack)) dove deep into PostgreSQL to teach it how to respond to GraphQL query strings as though they were SQL queries. Check out [GraphpostgresQL](https://github.com/solidsnack/GraphpostgresQL).

Espen Hovlandsdal ([rexxars](https://github.com/rexxars)) built a [sql-to-graphql](https://github.com/vaffel/sql-to-graphql) tool that can perform introspection on the tables of a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and produce a queryable HTTP GraphQL endpoint out of it.

Mick Hansen ([mickhansen](https://github.com/mickhansen)) offers a set of [schema-building helpers](https://github.com/mickhansen/graphql-sequelize) for use with the [Sequelize ORM](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/) for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL.

## GraphQL beyond JavaScript

Robert Mosolgo ([rmosolgo](https://github.com/rmosolgo)) brought the full set of schema-building and query execution tools to Ruby, in the form of [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) and [graphql-relay-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-relay-ruby). Check out his [Rails-based demo](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby-demo).

Andreas Marek ([andimarek](https://github.com/andimarek)) has brewed up a Java implementation of GraphQL, [graphql-java](https://github.com/andimarek/graphql-java).

[vladar](https://github.com/vladar) is hard at work on a PHP port of the GraphQL reference implementation, [graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php).

Taeho Kim ([dittos](https://github.com/dittos)) is bringing GraphQL to Python, with [graphql-py](https://github.com/dittos/graphql-py).

Oleg Ilyenko ([OlegIlyenko](https://github.com/OlegIlyenko)) made a beautiful and [delicious-looking website](http://sangria-graphql.org/) for a Scala implementation of GraphQL, [sangria](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria).

Joe McBride ([joemcbride](https://github.com/joemcbride)) has an up-and-running example of GraphQL for .NET, [graphql-dotnet](https://github.com/joemcbride/graphql-dotnet).

## Show me, don't tell me

</a>

Sam has already launched a product that leverages Relay's data-fetching, optimistic responses, pagination, and mutations &ndash; all atop a Ruby GraphQL server: [new.comique.co](http://new.comique.co/)

## Skeletons in the closet

Joseph Rollins ([fortruce](https://github.com/fortruce)) created a hot-reloading, auto schema-regenerating, [Relay skeleton](https://github.com/fortruce/relay-skeleton) that you can use to get up and running quickly.

Michael Hart ([mhart](https://mhart)) built a [simple-relay-starter](https://github.com/mhart/simple-relay-starter) kit using Browserify.

## Routing around

Jimmy Jia ([taion](@taion)) and Gerald Monaco ([devknoll](@devknoll)) have been helping lost URLs find their way to Relay apps through their work on [react-router-relay](relay-tools/react-router-relay). Check out Christoph Nakazawa's ([cpojer](@cpojer)) [blog post](medium.com/@cpojer/relay-and-routing-36b5439bad9) on the topic. Jimmy completed the Relay TodoMVC example with routing, which you can check out at [taion/relay-todomvc](taion/relay-todomvc).

Chen Hung-Tu ([transedward](https://github.com/transedward)) built a chat app atop the above mentioned router, with threaded conversations and pagination. Check it out at [transedward/relay-chat](https://github.com/transedward/relay-chat).
