We have already released two release candidates for React 15, and the final version is coming soon.

However [Ian Christian Myers](https://github.com/iancmyers) discovered a memory leak related to server rendering in React 0.14 and [contributed a fix](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6060). While this memory leak has already been fixed in a different way in the React 15 release candidates, we decided to cut another 0.14 release that contains just this fix.

The release is now available for download:

* **React**  
  Dev build with warnings: <https://fb.me/react-0.14.8.js>  
  Minified build for production: <https://fb.me/react-0.14.8.min.js>  
* **React with Add-Ons**  
  Dev build with warnings: <https://fb.me/react-with-addons-0.14.8.js>  
  Minified build for production: <https://fb.me/react-with-addons-0.14.8.min.js>  
* **React DOM** (include React in the page before React DOM)  
  Dev build with warnings: <https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.8.js>  
  Minified build for production: <https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.8.min.js>  
* **React DOM Server** (include React in the page before React DOM Server)  
  Dev build with warnings: <https://fb.me/react-dom-server-0.14.8.js>  
  Minified build for production: <https://fb.me/react-dom-server-0.14.8.min.js>

We've also published version `0.14.8` of the `react`, `react-dom`, and addons packages on npm and the `react` package on bower.
